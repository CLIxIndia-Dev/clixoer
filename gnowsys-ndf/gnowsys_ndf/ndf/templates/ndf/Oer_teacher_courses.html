TISS offers MOOCs and SPOCs through our own Course Management platform TISSx. The Reflective Teaching with ICT (RTICT) postgraduate certificate programme for teachers offers pedagogical courses to teachers to understand the design principles of OER, including CLIx modules, and how to use them in the teaching-learning process. The Postgraduate Certificate Programme in Contemporary Education Perspectives and Research (PGC-CEPR) enables teacher educators to strengthen their content, pedagogical and technological knowledge and strategise ways to facilitate teachers to facilitate student-led learning environments. Through TISSx we aim to reach learners in a wider range of settings and offer them unique, relevant, high-quality opportunities for continuous learning and professional development. TISSx can be accessed through a range of devices: desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
